Solutions : Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform : Enterprise-ready Kubernetes environment for building, deploying and managing container-based applications n any public or private data center. We decide when update to newer releases and which addition component to enable Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated : Managed OpenShift environment in a public cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, or IBM Cloud, all features of RHOCP, however Red Hat manage the cluster, we have some control of decisions as when to update to a newer release or to install add-ons. Red Hat OpenShift Online : Public container platform shared across multiple customers, Red Hat manages the cluster life cycle. Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine : Subset of the features present in OpenShift, such as coreOS, CRI-O engine, web console, etc Red Hat Code Ready Container : Minimal installation of OpenShift that we can run on a laptop to development and experimentation. Below the services and features of Openshift Introduction of OpenShift features Comparing OpenShift Container Platform vs OpenShift Kubernetes Engine: Features : High Availability : etc cluster store the state of the OpenShift Cluster and Applications Lightweight OS : CoreOS focuses on agility, portability and security Load Balancing : External via APU, HAProxy load balance for external app and internal load balance Automating Scaling : can adapt to increased application traffic in real time by automatically starting new containers and terminate when the load decrease. Logging and Monitoring : Advanced monitoring solution based on Prometheus, also advanced logging solution based on Elasticsearch. Service Discovery : Internal DNS, appl can rely on firendly names to find other appl and services Storage : Allow automatic provisioning of storage on popular cloud providers and visualization platforms Application Management : Automate the development and deploy, automatic build containers based on source code using Source-To-Image (S2I) solution. Cluster Extensibility : Rely on standard extension from kubernetes, Openshift packages these extensions as operators for ease of installation, update, and management. Also include Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which facilitates the discovery, installation, and update of applications and infrastructure components packaged as operators 6.1.2 Architecture of OpenShift OpenShift architecture is based on declarative the nature of kubernetes. In a declarative architecture, you change the state of the system and the system updates itself to comply with the new state. Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes that run the kubelet system service and a container engine. OpenShift runs exclusively the CRI-O container engine. Some nodes are control plane nodes that run the REST API, the etcd database, and the platform controllers OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution that provides many of these components already integrated and configured, and managed by operators. OpenShift also provides preinstalled applications, such as a container image registry and a web console, managed by operators. 6.1.3 Cluster Operators Kubernetes operators are applications that invoke the Kubernetes API to manage Kubernetes resources. Custom resources (CR) : store their settings and configurations Custom resource definition (CRD) : the syntax of a custom resource is defined by a custom resource definition Most operators manage another application; for example, an operator that manages a database server.The purpose of an operator is usually to automate tasks. Operator Software Development Kit (Operator SDK) : Golang library and source code. Also provide container image and ansible playbook examples. Operator Life Cycle Manager (OLM) : Appl that manages the deployment, resource utilization, updates and deletion of operators. The OLM itself is an operator that comes preinstalled with OpenShift. OperatorHub OperatorHub provides a web interface to discover and publish operators that follow the Operator Framework standards. Red Hat Marketplace is a plataform that allow access a curated set of enterprise operators that can be deployed on OpenShit or a kubernetes cluster OpenShift Cluster Operators : regular operators except that they are not managed by the OLM, they are managed by OpenShift Cluster Version Operators, also called as first level operator. 6.1.4 Verifying the Health of a Cluster "]]
