# Intro

During some Linux courses I usually take notes for future reference, so I use this notes to organize my notes for study and future projects.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
